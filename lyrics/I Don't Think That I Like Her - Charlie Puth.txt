Get her name and get her number

Find out all of the things that we have in common

Never all the differences, oh yeah

Meet her parents, meet her brother

Then she starts sleepin' over the crib on weekends

Like a real relationship, oh no



For me, the stars are alignin'

But for her it's bad timin'

So she just can't be mine



I don't think that I like her anymore

Girls are all the same

All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart, ah-ah

I don't think that I like her anymore

Girls are all the same

They just wanna see me fall apart, apart, ah-ah



So I hook up on a rebound

And I say that I'm gonna be single for life

But she's so pretty and nice (pretty and nice)

So I make just one exception

But I find out eventually I'm not her type

Baby, that's the reason why, that



For me, the stars are alignin'

But for her, it's bad timin'

So she just can't be mine



I don't think that I like her anymore (yeah)

Girls are all the same

All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart, ah-ah

I don't think that I like her anymore (no)

Girls are all the same

They just wanna see me fall apart, apart, ah-ah



(Yeah, yeah)



I'm trying not to be bitter

But damn it, I miss her

'Cause she's one of a kind (one of a kind)



For me, the stars are alignin'

But for her, it's bad timin'

So she just can't be mine



I don't think that I like her anymore

Girls are all the same

All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart, ah-ah

I don't think that I like her anymore

Girls are all the same

They just wanna see me fall apart, apart, ah-ah



(I don't think that I like her anymore)

(Girls are all the same)

(All they wanna do is break my heart)

Then we fall, fall, fall, fall apart now



I don't think that I like her anymore

Girls are all the same

They just wanna see me fall apart, apart, ah-ah
